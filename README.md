## 💖 Support KinaBot (Optional Sponsorship)

KinaBot is an **open-source**, **non-medical** project exploring how everyday speech can help families better understand cognitive *trends* in aging.  
We keep the code open and free so that researchers, students, caregivers, and families can experiment, learn, and build on it.

If you find KinaBot useful or believe in its mission to support an aging society, you can optionally sponsor the project via GitHub Sponsors. Your support helps us:

- 🧪 Run experiments and evaluations (e.g., model training, benchmarking)
- ☁️ Cover cloud, storage, and demo hosting costs
- 🛠️ Improve documentation, examples, and usability for non-experts
- 🌍 Keep KinaBot free and accessible for families and educators

Sponsorship is **completely optional**.  
KinaBot will remain open source and free to use.

> **Important:** KinaBot is **not** a medical device and does **not** provide diagnosis, treatment, or clinical decision-making.  
> Sponsoring this project does **not** create a doctor–patient relationship or provide any kind of priority medical service.  
> For any medical or cognitive health concerns, please consult qualified healthcare professionals.

By sponsoring, you are supporting open research and practical tools that aim to give older adults and their families more ways to understand cognitive trends with dignity, transparency, and respect.
