Welcome to the KINA (Kognitive Intelligence Neural Assessment) documentation directory.

## Available Documentation

### 📊 [signals.md](signals.md)
Comprehensive guide to KINA's cognitive health signals:
- **Lexical Diversity** (30% weight) - Vocabulary richness analysis
- **Speech Fluency** (25% weight) - Speaking rate and temporal patterns
- **Sentence Complexity** (25% weight) - Syntactic sophistication measurement
- **Emotional Expression** (20% weight) - Affective language analysis

Includes detailed calculation methods, scoring ranges, clinical significance, and technical implementation details.

## Quick Reference

| Signal | Weight | Optimal Range | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------------|---------|
| Lexical Diversity | 30% | ≥0.75 | Vocabulary richness |
| Speech Fluency | 25% | 2.0-3.0 words/sec | Speaking rate |
| Sentence Complexity | 25% | 12-20 words/sentence | Syntactic complexity |
| Emotional Expression | 20% | -0.1 to +0.3 polarity | Emotional balance |

## Overall Scoring

- **80-100**: Low Risk 🟢
- **65-79**: Low-Moderate Risk 🟡  
- **50-64**: Moderate Risk 🟠
- **0-49**: Higher Risk 🔴

## Getting Started

1. Read [signals.md](signals.md) for detailed signal explanations
2. Review the technical implementation section
3. Understand the clinical applications and limitations
